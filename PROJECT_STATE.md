# Project State

Last updated: 2026-10-03 (F-071 Originality Check, after F-070 Fact Check Result)

This file is the handoff document. A new session should read it, together with `TASK_STATUS.md`, before doing anything else. There is no need to audit the repository again from the start.

## Next task

**F-072 Script Validator** (Prompt Pack v8, Phase F Script & Fact Check, prompt 72). It depends on F-071, which has PASSED.

> Validate length, required sections, language and content-type rules.

Note: the pack does not say what the length rule measures (the words or the estimated seconds of `Script.estimated_seconds` against the `DurationTarget` of #064, or a word limit per content type, and whether outside the range is a WARN or a FAIL), which sections each content type requires (Shorts: HOOK, BODY and CTA as the #066 generator writes them; LongForm: HOOK, INTRO, CHAPTERs, OUTRO and CTA as #067 writes them; the order and the number of chapters), how the language is checked (against the strategy primary language, by a deterministic EN/VI heuristic or a language detection library, and the tolerance for mixed text), what "content-type rules" are beyond sections and length (the banned phrases of #066/#067, a CTA only at the end, a hook before any body), what the result looks like (PASS/WARN/FAIL with a code per rule like F-070/F-071, and whether it reuses `FactCheckStatus`/`OriginalityStatus` or gets its own enum), whether it also reads the F-070 and F-071 results, whether it is rules only or may use the text provider, whether it blocks anything (a gate on approval or on production) or is a record only, how it is stored (one run per script version in a new table?), the trigger (on demand, like F-068..F-071) and whether a user may override a result. Confirm these with the user before implementing, offering 3-4 alternatives per question.

F-071 Originality Check has PASSED. `OriginalityChecker` (`content/originality_checker.py`) flags excessive reuse and repetitive structure in one stored script version against prior content, on demand, by deterministic rules (`content/originality.py`, method `originality-rules-v1`, no AI model, record only). Prior content (`ScriptRepository.list_prior_latest`): the latest version of every OTHER content item of the same channel, taken among the scripts created strictly before this script (so the version is the highest one with `created_at` below the cut-off), newest 50 (`MAX_PRIORS`, order `created_at` DESC then rowid DESC), whatever the item status; earlier versions of the same item and other channels are never compared, so an older script is never flagged for newer content. Reuse: NFC then `similarity.words` (casefold), stop words kept, CTA sections left out of every rule, at most 20,000 words read per script (`MAX_WORDS`, in order, the rest ignored), word 5-gram shingles (sets, per section); containment = the share of this script's shingles found in one prior; per prior, containment >= 60% is FAIL `near_duplicate`, else >= 25% with >= 8 shared shingles WARN `high_overlap`; and independently >= 3 distinct sentences of >= 8 words that appear exactly (normalised) in the prior WARN `copied_sentences` (sentences by `claim_extraction.split_sentences`); a script of fewer than 20 non-CTA words (`MIN_WORDS`) gets no reuse finding (its word count is stored on the run). Structure, WARN only: `repeated_hook` (the first 4 words of the first sentence of the HOOK section, or of section 0 without a HOOK, equal those of >= 3 compared priors; one finding, `matched` = how many), `repeated_sentences` (sentences of >= 5 words repeating inside the script, >= 2 repeats in all; one finding, `matched` = repeats, `section_index` of the first repeat), `repeated_openers` (of the sentences of >= 2 words, at least 4 and >= 40% start with the same 2 words; one finding, `score` = the share). Thresholds are whole-number percentages, so a boundary is exact; scores are rounded DOWN to 3 decimals (1499 of 2500 is 0.599, a WARN); at most 800,000 characters (`MAX_CHARS`) of a script are read before the word cap; the v1 value rules (min words, hook matches, 3-decimal scores) are checked only for runs of method `originality-rules-v1`. Languages without word spaces (CJK) are not detected by n-grams. `Finding` (frozen: closed `OriginalityCode`, status, optional prior script/content item ids, `section_index`, `score` 0..1 of 3 decimals, `matched`; ids, scores and counts only, never script text); own `OriginalityStatus` (pass, warn, fail); `OriginalityCheck` run (findings, counts, `words`, `priors_count`, validated; derived `status` = worst finding, no prior and no finding = PASS). Record only: no gate (no change to `core/gates.py`), no #072 wiring, immutable, no override (a later task may add a separate override table). `OriginalityChecker(database, audit, clock).check(script_id, actor)`: it needs only a stored script (unknown -> `ScriptNotFoundError` 404; no F-068..F-070 run is needed); a stored run is returned before the priors are read, without writing or auditing, and is never recomputed; the rules run outside the write transaction, the run and its findings are stored in one; an `IntegrityError` (unique `script_id`) re-reads and returns the stored run, else re-raises; `originality.checked` (entity `script`, ids and counts only) is audited after commit. Migration `0020_originality_checks.sql`: STRICT `originality_checks` (script_id UNIQUE FK, content item; method open text with a length check; words 0-20000, priors_count 0-50, findings_count 0-103 (`MAX_FINDINGS`) with warn + fail = findings_count; requested_by; created_at GLOB; index by item) and `originality_findings` (FK to the run; status CHECK of the enum list but never `pass`; `code` open text with a length check (closed in Python only); prior script and content item nullable FKs, both or neither; section_index, score 0-1, matched nullable with CHECKs; index by run); no ALTER of existing tables; a test ties the SQL bounds to the Python constants. `OriginalityRepository` (add, get, get_by_script; findings ordered by rowid). Bootstrap registers the checker. F-064..F-070 behaviour and rows, `FactCheckStatus` and the F-070 tables, migrations 0001-0019, `content/similarity.py`, providers and strategy are unchanged. Tests: 3602 (3431 before, 171 new: `tests/test_originality.py` 89, `tests/test_originality_checker.py` 81, 1 in the B-029 migration tests).

F-070 Fact Check Result has PASSED. `FactChecker` (`content/fact_checker.py`) gives every claim of one stored claim extraction run a PASS, WARN or FAIL result from the stored evidence matching run, on demand, by deterministic rules (`content/fact_check.py`, method `rules-v1`, no AI model); per claim the first matching row wins: the matching run has no report (WARN `no_report`); no links (WARN `unmatched`); a numeric or date claim with a differ link and no agree link (FAIL `numbers_differ`, the only FAIL); an agree and a differ link both (WARN `sources_conflict`); a numeric or date claim with no agree link (WARN `number_unverified`); all linked research claims of high uncertainty (WARN `weak_evidence`); an absolute claim with exactly 1 link whose uncertainty is not low (WARN `absolute_needs_support`); exactly 1 link with a best score under `STRONG_SCORE` (0.75) and numbers not agree (WARN `low_score`); otherwise PASS `supported`. The uncertainty of a claim is the lowest (most certain) of the research claims its links matched, read in the research report of the matching run (`research_claim_id` must exist in it, else an error); a claim without a kind is not numeric. A result keeps a snapshot of what the rules read (links, best score, numbers agree/differ/none, uncertainty). `FactCheck` is one stored run per matching run with its results and counts, and a derived `status` (the worst result; no claim is PASS). It is a record only: no gate reads it, nothing blocks on it (no change to `core/gates.py`, no #072 wiring), it is never changed, and no override exists (a later task may add a separate `fact_check_overrides` table). Stored in the new `fact_checks` and `fact_check_results` tables (migration 0019; the result `code` is open text in SQL, since a later rule version may add one without a table rebuild, and closed in Python as `FactCheckCode`); a second call returns the stored run before the report is read, without writing or auditing; a concurrent run that stored first is re-read; `facts.checked` is audited after commit with scalar counts only. An unknown script raises `ScriptNotFoundError` (404), a version without extracted claims `ClaimsNotExtractedError` (409), one without a matching run the new `EvidenceNotMatchedError` (`domain.evidence_not_matched`, 409), and a missing report `ResearchReportNotFoundError` (404). Bootstrap registers the checker. F-068/F-069 behaviour and rows, the ResearchReport schema (v1) and providers are unchanged. Tests: 3431 (3319 before, 112 new).

Earlier task summaries (F-069 back to A-001, and the Phase A start note) were moved verbatim to `CHANGELOG.md`, section "Task summaries (moved from PROJECT_STATE.md)".

## Known failures

| Category | Count |
|---|---|
| PRE_EXISTING | 0 |
| ENVIRONMENT | 0 |
| TOOLING | 0 |
| UNKNOWN | 0 |

Two notes do not block anything:
- The Docker daemon is not reachable. Docker is deferred.
- On 2026-09-30 Windows Application Control blocked the `pytest.exe` launcher (`uv run pytest` fails with os error 4551). `uv run python -m pytest` and `uv run python -m ruff` work and give the same results. This is an ENVIRONMENT note, not a code failure.
- uv reports "Failed to hardlink files" because the uv cache is on drive C: and the project is on drive D:. Installs still succeed.

## Foundation build baseline (A-012)

Measured on `59fcd2d` on 2026-09-28. The full report is `docs/A-012_BUILD_BASELINE.md`.

| Check | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Environment | `uv sync --locked` | PASS (26 packages) |
| Lockfile | `uv lock --check` | PASS |
| Tests | `uv run pytest` | 132 passed, 0 failed. Also passes with `-W error` and on 5 repeated runs |
| Lint | `uv run ruff check .` | PASS |
| Format | `uv run ruff format --check .` | PASS |
| Build | `uv build` | PASS (wheel + sdist). The installed wheel imports and runs |
| Run | `uv run uvicorn ai_youtube_agent.main:app` | `GET /health` returns 200 with `status: ok` and the checks `settings` and `feature_flags` |

Any failure that appears after `59fcd2d` comes from a later change. It is not pre-existing.

## Bootstrap baseline

Commit `3b41416` (`chore: bootstrap ai_youtube_agent project`) is the code baseline after Project Initialization. Later commits up to `6ce7d3b` changed documentation only.

| Check | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Tests | `uv run pytest` | 1 passed, 0 failed |
| Lint | `uv run ruff check .` | PASS |
| Format | `uv run ruff format --check .` | PASS |
| Lockfile | `uv lock --check` | PASS (24 packages) |
| Build | `uv build` | PASS (wheel + sdist) |
| Run | `uv run uvicorn ai_youtube_agent.main:app` | `GET /health` returns 200 `{"status":"ok","version":"0.1.0"}` |

These checks were last run in Task 010. Any failure that appears after `3b41416` comes from a later change. It is not pre-existing.

## Invariants

Every future task must keep these true:

1. **Prompt Pack v8 is the source of truth** for task definitions. The file is `AI_YouTube_Autonomous_Agent_PROMPT_PACK_v8_BASELINE_SAFE.pdf`, stored outside the repository in `D:\Downloads`. Do not invent or guess tasks.
2. **One task at a time.** Follow Inspect → Baseline → Implement only scope → Targeted tests → Relevant regression tests → Reclassify failures → Report → PASS/FAIL. Stop after each task.
3. **Global Baseline Rule.** A task never fails because of an unrelated pre-existing error. A regression caused by the task is a FAIL. A failure of unknown origin is UNKNOWN: stop and investigate.
4. **The stack is fixed:** Python 3.11, FastAPI, uv, pytest, ruff, with the `src/` and `tests/` layout. Change it only if the user asks.
5. **Dependencies only through uv** (`uv add` / `uv add --dev`), and `uv.lock` is committed.
6. **Green gate before finishing a task:** `uv run pytest`, `uv run ruff check .` and `uv run ruff format --check .` must pass.
7. **No secrets in source control.** Credentials, API keys and OAuth secrets stay out of Git. `.env` is ignored.
8. **No auto-publish and no strategy drift.** A production publish always needs a valid approval. Market, language, niche, format, budget and channel are never changed on the AI's own initiative.
9. **Do not re-run Phase 0 or re-bootstrap.** The project exists. Do not reset or delete it.
10. **Keep state files current.** Update `PROJECT_STATE.md`, `TASK_STATUS.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` at the end of each task.
11. **Push only when the user asks.**
12. **Route every task first.** Before implementing a task, classify it with the Task/Model Router (`tools/task_router.py`, policy in `.claude/task-router.json`, rules in `docs/TASK_ROUTER.md`, summary in `CLAUDE.md`) and follow the routed profile (model/effort) of each role (planner, coder, reviewer); Opus only on evidence (Opus triggers); escalate only with a reason and evidence; record runs, gate and result in the router telemetry. User overrides win unless they break a rule above.

## Workflow infrastructure

Task/Model Router (2026-10-03, after F-067; not a Prompt Pack task, so it has no TASK_STATUS row and does not change the state machine). User-approved: routed subagents per level generated from the policy (`.claude/agents/task-{planner,coder,reviewer}-<level>.md`), a deterministic scoring script with floors and tests (`tests/test_task_router.py`, 45 tests), the main session keeps the user's Opus setting (no project model setting), commit without push. Default policy: TRIVIAL haiku/low, SIMPLE sonnet/low, NORMAL sonnet/medium + planner, COMPLEX opus/high + planner + reviewer, ARCHITECTURAL opus/high + planner + reviewer + architecture review; escalation at most 2 steps up the ladder, never to xhigh/max without a user override. Nothing in `src/`, the migrations or earlier tests changed.

TOOL-002 Cost-Aware Task Router (2026-10-03, after F-069; workflow infrastructure, not a Prompt Pack task: no TASK_STATUS row, no change to `src/`, the migrations or the state machine; NEXT_TASK stays F-070). User-approved design B: complexity (score, weights, thresholds, floors, levels) is unchanged; execution is a `model/effort` profile per role from policy schema_version 2 (allowed: haiku/low, sonnet/low, sonnet/medium, sonnet/high, opus/medium, opus/high; xhigh/max only by user override). TRIVIAL coder haiku/low; SIMPLE coder sonnet/low; NORMAL planner + coder sonnet/medium (reviewer sonnet/high only for a behaviour change with a high risk); COMPLEX planner + coder sonnet/high, reviewer opus/high; ARCHITECTURAL opus/high everywhere + architecture review. Evidence-based Opus triggers from an optional risk profile (derived from the criteria when missing) lift NORMAL to opus/medium and COMPLEX to opus/high; high regression/migration risk without architecture impact raises the coder's effort on Sonnet. Escalation ladder haiku/low → … → opus/high, at most 2 steps. Subagents are named by role and profile (`.claude/agents/task-<role>-<model>-<effort>.md`, 12 files; the level-named files were removed). Append-only telemetry `.claude/router-telemetry.jsonl` (`record`, `report`, `compare`), backfilled for F-065..F-069. v1 policies and decisions still load. The per-task history paragraphs moved verbatim to `CHANGELOG.md`. `tests/test_task_router.py` now has 203 tests. Details: `docs/TASK_ROUTER.md`.

## How to resume

```sh
git status --short --branch   # expect a clean tree on main
uv sync                       # recreate .venv if needed
uv run python -m pytest       # expect 3602 passed (132 at the A-012 baseline)
uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check .
```

Then start the task marked NOT_STARTED first in `TASK_STATUS.md`, which is F-072 right now.

The change from EMPTY to EXISTING is a valid state transition caused by Project Initialization. It is not a pre-existing failure. The files in the baseline were created by that task, so they are not PRE_EXISTING relative to the original empty state.
