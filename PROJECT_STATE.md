# Project State

Last updated: 2026-09-25 (Task 011 Project Handoff)

This file is the handoff document. A new session should read it, together with `TASK_STATUS.md`, before doing anything else. There is no need to audit the repository again from the start.

## Current state

```
PROJECT_STATE      = READY_FOR_PHASE_A
BASELINE_COMMIT    = 3b41416
CURRENT_CHECKPOINT = 6ce7d3b
BASELINE_STATUS    = CLEAN
TEST_STATUS        = PASS
LINT_STATUS        = PASS
BUILD_STATUS       = PASS
KNOWN_FAILURES     = NONE
UNKNOWN_BLOCKERS   = NONE
NEXT_TASK          = A-001 Project Audit
```

## Next task

**A-001 Project Audit** (Prompt Pack v8, Phase A, prompt 1). It has no dependency.

> Inspect repository, runtime, existing modules and tests. Do not change code. Produce architecture/state report and dependency risks.

Phase 0 (000–011) is complete, which meets the pack rule that Phase A may start only after Prompt 011 PASSES. Run the Phase A prompts in order, and do not start a prompt until the previous one has PASSED. The full list is in `TASK_STATUS.md`.

## Known failures

| Category | Count |
|---|---|
| PRE_EXISTING | 0 |
| ENVIRONMENT | 0 |
| TOOLING | 0 |
| UNKNOWN | 0 |

Two notes do not block anything:
- The Docker daemon is not reachable. Docker is deferred.
- uv reports "Failed to hardlink files" because the uv cache is on drive C: and the project is on drive D:. Installs still succeed.

## Baseline

Commit `3b41416` (`chore: bootstrap ai_youtube_agent project`) is the code baseline after Project Initialization. Later commits up to `6ce7d3b` changed documentation only.

| Check | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Tests | `uv run pytest` | 1 passed, 0 failed |
| Lint | `uv run ruff check .` | PASS |
| Format | `uv run ruff format --check .` | PASS |
| Lockfile | `uv lock --check` | PASS (24 packages) |
| Build | `uv build` | PASS (wheel + sdist) |
| Run | `uv run uvicorn ai_youtube_agent.main:app` | `GET /health` returns 200 `{"status":"ok","version":"0.1.0"}` |

These checks were last run in Task 010. Any failure that appears after `3b41416` comes from a later change. It is not pre-existing.

## Repository status

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Local path | `D:\Project_Audit` |
| Remote | `origin` = https://github.com/Dung02052002/Audit.git |
| Branch | `main`, tracking `origin/main` |
| Pushed checkpoint | `6ce7d3b` (`docs: close clean baseline gate, ready for phase A`) |
| Tracked code | `src/ai_youtube_agent/__init__.py`, `src/ai_youtube_agent/main.py`, `tests/test_health.py` |
| Ignored | `.venv/`, `dist/`, `.pytest_cache/`, `.ruff_cache/`, `__pycache__/`, `.env` |

## Toolchain

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| OS | Windows 11 Pro. Shells: PowerShell 5.1 and Git Bash |
| Language / runtime | Python 3.11.9 (`requires-python = ">=3.11,<3.12"`) |
| Project type | Backend / AI agent |
| Framework | FastAPI 0.141, served by uvicorn 0.54 |
| Package manager | uv 0.12.1 (build backend `uv_build`) |
| Test runner | pytest 9.1.1, with `httpx2` for `TestClient` |
| Formatter / linter | ruff 0.16.9 (rules E, F, I, UP, B, SIM; line length 88) |
| Package | `ai_youtube_agent` |
| Layout | `src/ai_youtube_agent/`, `tests/` |
| Docker | Deferred. The CLI is installed but the daemon is not running |
| CI | Deferred |

## Invariants

Every future task must keep these true:

1. **Prompt Pack v8 is the source of truth** for task definitions. The file is `AI_YouTube_Autonomous_Agent_PROMPT_PACK_v8_BASELINE_SAFE.pdf`, stored outside the repository in `D:\Downloads`. Do not invent or guess tasks.
2. **One task at a time.** Follow Inspect → Baseline → Implement only scope → Targeted tests → Relevant regression tests → Reclassify failures → Report → PASS/FAIL. Stop after each task.
3. **Global Baseline Rule.** A task never fails because of an unrelated pre-existing error. A regression caused by the task is a FAIL. A failure of unknown origin is UNKNOWN: stop and investigate.
4. **The stack is fixed:** Python 3.11, FastAPI, uv, pytest, ruff, with the `src/` and `tests/` layout. Change it only if the user asks.
5. **Dependencies only through uv** (`uv add` / `uv add --dev`), and `uv.lock` is committed.
6. **Green gate before finishing a task:** `uv run pytest`, `uv run ruff check .` and `uv run ruff format --check .` must pass.
7. **No secrets in source control.** Credentials, API keys and OAuth secrets stay out of Git. `.env` is ignored.
8. **No auto-publish and no strategy drift.** A production publish always needs a valid approval. Market, language, niche, format, budget and channel are never changed on the AI's own initiative.
9. **Do not re-run Phase 0 or re-bootstrap.** The project exists. Do not reset or delete it.
10. **Keep state files current.** Update `PROJECT_STATE.md`, `TASK_STATUS.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` at the end of each task.
11. **Push only when the user asks.**

## How to resume

```sh
git status --short --branch   # expect a clean tree on main
uv sync                       # recreate .venv if needed
uv run pytest                 # expect 1 passed
uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check .
```

Then start the task marked NOT_STARTED first in `TASK_STATUS.md`, which is A-001 right now.

## State history

| Step | Classification | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Tasks 001–005 (initial audit) | EMPTY / CLEAN EMPTY STATE | Correct at that time: the repository had 0 files and no Git. |
| Project Initialization | EMPTY → EXISTING | The minimal project was created and committed as `3b41416`. |
| State drift audit | EXISTING | Confirmed from the filesystem. |
| State tracking (`5821e98`) | EXISTING_INITIALIZED | State files added. Code is unchanged from `3b41416`. |
| Task 007 Clean Baseline Gate | EXISTING_INITIALIZED → READY_FOR_PHASE_A | Gate PASS. Baseline Gate is OPEN. |
| Tasks 008–010 | READY_FOR_PHASE_A | Bootstrap app, tests and clean gate verified. No code changes. |
| Task 011 Project Handoff | READY_FOR_PHASE_A | Handoff completed. Phase 0 is complete. |

The change from EMPTY to EXISTING is a valid state transition caused by Project Initialization. It is not a pre-existing failure. The files in the baseline were created by that task, so they are not PRE_EXISTING relative to the original empty state.

## Scope not started

- Phase A and every later phase (B–T)
- AI YouTube business logic (Research, Script, Voice, YouTube API, etc.)
- Docker and CI
