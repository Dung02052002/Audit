# Project State

Last updated: 2026-10-04 (F-074 Script Tests, after F-073 Script Versioning; Phase F complete)

This file is the handoff document. A new session should read it, together with `TASK_STATUS.md`, before doing anything else. There is no need to audit the repository again from the start.

## Next task

**G-075 Asset Model** (Prompt Pack v8, Phase G Rights, Policy & AI Disclosure, prompt 75). It depends on F-074 (Phase F), which has PASSED.

> Define generated, licensed, public-domain and user-owned asset categories.

Note: the pack line is one sentence, so these are open and must be confirmed with the user before implementing, offering 3-4 alternatives per question: (1) the scope: an entity only (frozen dataclasses and enums in `content/`, like the B-013..B-022 entities, with or without a migration and a repository) or also storing; (2) the categories: exactly generated, licensed, public-domain and user-owned as a closed enum, or more values (for example unknown) and whether the category is derived or declared; (3) what an asset is: which kinds (image, video clip, audio or music, font, voice, subtitle file, template), which fields (name or title, kind, category, source, owner, license reference, attribution text and whether it is required, file or URL reference), and how it relates to the existing `Artifact` (`core/artifact.py`), `Rights` (`content/rights.py`, B-019) and `Script` entities; (4) the split with the later tasks: what stays for #076 Asset Registry (registering every asset used in a video), #077 Provenance Record (source and license/provenance metadata) and #078 Rights Risk Engine (does a category carry a default risk level, or does #075 define no risk at all).

F-074 Script Tests has PASSED, and Phase F (Script & Fact Check, #065-#074) is complete. Scope the user approved (2026-10-04): test-only end-to-end scenarios in the pattern of E-063 `tests/test_research_flow.py`, plus targeted gap tests in existing files, plus one defect fix the tests found. New `tests/test_script_flow.py` (39 tests): one `Flow` (a subclass of the `World` of `tests/test_hook_generator.py`, which is not edited) wires the hook generator, the Shorts and LongForm generators, `ClaimExtractor`, `EvidenceMatcher`, `FactChecker`, `OriginalityChecker`, `ScriptValidator` and `ScriptVersioner` like bootstrap with one clock (a distinct tick per call); the mock `TextGenerator` answers are fixed queued JSON per scenario. The research report is built through the mock research chain (real topics and sources, as `World.report` does) and then given hand-made `ResearchClaim` values with `dataclasses.replace`, stored under a fresh request (the collector adds no evidence notes, see E-063). Scenarios: (1) Shorts hook -> v1 -> claims, matching, fact check (mixed PASS and WARN, `sources_conflict`), originality, validation (PASS for generator output) -> v2 with a second hook and an edited body -> revision (changed and unchanged entries, `words_delta` sums) -> history; (2) LongForm with chapters on and off through validation and a revision; (3) evidence gaps, each on its own script (unmatched, `numbers_differ` FAIL that blocks nothing and changes neither validation nor revision, `sources_conflict`, `number_unverified`, `weak_evidence`, a report without claims, no report); (4) Vietnamese and Unicode (NFD script against an NFC report note, claim text kept verbatim, English terms inside Vietnamese text, `content_sha256` stable and exact, emoji and combining marks through the revision); (5) empty and boundary inputs (no claims, 3 BODY cap, inclusive duration limits at 15 and 60 seconds through rejection and re-ask, a sentence repeated across sections, the 200-claim cap from a LongForm script to the fact check); (6) malformed answers (invalid JSON, extra keys, a banned phrase, three rejects store nothing and no later-stage row exists, a malformed outline); (7) ordering and reruns (a second call returns the stored run without writing or auditing, out-of-order calls give 409, validation and originality need no other run, earlier rows stay unchanged, history order); (8) originality (a copy in another item is a `near_duplicate`, earlier versions of the same item and other channels are never compared); (9) abnormal database data (a report row removed, a script pointing at a removed report with foreign keys off, a corrupted and a renamed report claim, a removed parent script); (10) revisions (5 versions recorded out of order, history with versions without a revision, v1 refused with 422, approvals and artifacts rows unchanged, a no-change version added directly is allowed); (11) the audit actions in order and no script text in any audit row or run table (a SECRET marker found only in `scripts` and `claims`). Defect found and fixed: the race in `store_script` (scenario 12). Reproduced first: a version stored by another writer while the provider was answering made `ScriptRepository.add` raise an uncaught `sqlite3.IntegrityError` (unique content item and version) for a first script and for a next version, with no failure audited. Fix (`content/script_generation.py`, user decision): inside the write transaction (`BEGIN IMMEDIATE`) `store_script` re-reads the item's latest script; when it is not the version the generator read it stores nothing, audits `script.generation_failed` (metadata `stage` `store`, `code` `script_conflict`, `expected_version`, `latest_version`) and raises the new `ScriptConflictError` (409, code `domain.script_conflict`); a script is never silently re-parented. Regression tests for both generators (first and next version, nothing stored, the retry is written from the new latest version): 2 in `tests/test_shorts_script_generator.py` and 2 in `tests/test_longform_script_generator.py`. Found and NOT fixed (reported for a decision, it would change the F-064/F-065 word counts and the revision hashes of existing data): `ScriptSection.words` and `hook.count_words` count `\w+` on the text as stored, so text in Unicode form NFD (decomposed Vietnamese) is counted about twice (13 words in NFC, 24 in NFD; 6 against 10 estimated seconds), while claim extraction, matching, originality and validation read the NFC form; the tests therefore do not assert word counts or seconds of NFD text. No other source file, migration, gate, approval, provider or the strategy changed. Tests: 4197 (4154 before, 43 new: 39 in `tests/test_script_flow.py`, 2 in each generator test file).

F-073 Script Versioning has PASSED. `ScriptVersioner` (`content/script_versioner.py`) stores a revision of one stored script version: the diff metadata of the version against its parent only (method `script-diff-v1`, deterministic, no AI model, record only; `content/script_revision.py`). Version 1 has no parent and no revision. No script text is stored anywhere (rows, entries, audit, history). A revision holds: counts added, removed, changed and unchanged (their sum is `entries_count`, at most 200 = `MAX_ENTRIES`), `words_before`/`words_after`, `seconds_before`/`seconds_after` (the `estimated_seconds` of the parent and of the version), `content_sha256` and one entry per aligned section: `change` (added, removed, changed, unchanged), `old_index` and `new_index` (0..99, none for an added or a removed section), `kind`, the flags `text_changed`/`title_changed`/`seconds_changed` (0 for added, removed and unchanged; at least one for changed), `words_delta` (new words minus old words: added +words, removed -words, unchanged 0, so the deltas add up to `words_after - words_before`) and `sha256` (the section key of the new section, of the old one when removed). Hashes (defined once in `script_revision.py`): a section key is the SHA-256 of the canonical JSON of `{kind, title, text, seconds}` (`seconds` = `estimated_seconds`; keys sorted, no spaces, non-ASCII kept, UTF-8; text compared exactly, not normalised); `content_sha256` is the SHA-256 of the canonical JSON array of the sections of the new version, in order. Unchanged = kind, title, text and estimated seconds all equal. The hashes cover the estimated seconds, so versions that differ only in declared seconds against none with the same estimate get the same `content_sha256` (it is not a fingerprint of the stored row). Alignment (pure `diff_scripts(old, new)`, nothing stored): longest common subsequence over the exact section keys (a tie keeps the earlier old index); inside each gap between two matches the old and new sections of the same kind are paired in order (a second LCS over the kinds, same tie rule) as changed, the rest are removed and added; a moved section is one removed and one added entry; entries are ordered so that old and new indexes both only grow; `ScriptRevision` (frozen: validation, `create`, `counts`, `summary`) checks that the diff belongs to the two scripts (`create`) and the v1 rules (indexes once in order from 0, word deltas add up, counts match entries) only for method `script-diff-v1`. A revision with no change at all is allowed. `ScriptVersioner(database, audit, *, clock=None).record(script_id, *, actor)`: unknown script `ScriptNotFoundError` (404); version 1, a missing parent or a parent of another content item `ScriptInputError` (422); any actor may record (derived data); a stored revision is returned before the parent is read, without computing, writing or auditing, and never recomputed; the diff runs outside the write transaction, the revision and its entries are stored in one; an `IntegrityError` (unique `script_id`) re-reads and returns the stored revision, else re-raises; `script.revision_recorded` (entity `script`, ids and counts only) is audited after commit. `history(content_item_id)` (read only, no HTTP route) gives per version in order the script id, version, parent id, `created_by`, reason, strategy version, words, seconds and the revision summary or None; an unknown content item is `ContentItemNotFoundError` (404). Migration `0022_script_revisions.sql`: STRICT `script_revisions` (script_id UNIQUE FK, parent FK, content item, method open text with a length check, version >= 2, counts with a CHECK that their sum = entries_count (0..200), words/seconds >= 0, content_sha256 64 lowercase hex, requested_by, created_at GLOB, index by item) and `script_revision_sections` (revision FK, `change` open text with a length check, `kind` CHECK of `SectionKind`, indexes 0..99 nullable and consistent with the change, flags 0/1, words_delta sign by change, optional sha256 64 lowercase hex, UNIQUE per revision on old and on new index); no ALTER of existing tables; a test ties the SQL bounds to the Python constants. `ScriptRevisionRepository` (add, get, get_by_script, list_by_content_item by version; entries ordered by rowid). Bootstrap registers the versioner. Correction (docs only): a new script version does NOT already invalidate approvals. In code, approvals bind artifacts only (`ArtifactKind` video, audio, subtitles, thumbnail, metadata; C-035 `VersionInvalidation` reacts to a new artifact version) and `store_script` never touches approvals, so a new script version invalidates nothing until it is rendered into new artifacts. A revision is not related to approvals or to the F-068..F-072 runs of a version. No restore of an earlier version exists (open question for a later task). F-064..F-072 behaviour and rows, `content/script.py` entities (docstring line only), `store_script` and the generators, `core/version_invalidation.py`, `content/approval.py`, `core/gates.py`, providers, strategy and migrations 0001-0021 are unchanged. Tests: 4141 (3903 before, 236 new: `tests/test_script_revision.py` 131, `tests/test_script_versioner.py` 104, 1 in the B-029 migration tests).

Earlier task summaries (F-072 back to A-001, and the Phase A start note) were moved verbatim to `CHANGELOG.md`, section "Task summaries (moved from PROJECT_STATE.md)".

## Known failures

| Category | Count |
|---|---|
| PRE_EXISTING | 0 |
| ENVIRONMENT | 0 |
| TOOLING | 0 |
| UNKNOWN | 0 |

Two notes do not block anything:
- The Docker daemon is not reachable. Docker is deferred.
- On 2026-09-30 Windows Application Control blocked the `pytest.exe` launcher (`uv run pytest` fails with os error 4551). `uv run python -m pytest` and `uv run python -m ruff` work and give the same results. This is an ENVIRONMENT note, not a code failure.
- uv reports "Failed to hardlink files" because the uv cache is on drive C: and the project is on drive D:. Installs still succeed.

## Foundation build baseline (A-012)

Measured on `59fcd2d` on 2026-09-28. The full report is `docs/A-012_BUILD_BASELINE.md`.

| Check | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Environment | `uv sync --locked` | PASS (26 packages) |
| Lockfile | `uv lock --check` | PASS |
| Tests | `uv run pytest` | 132 passed, 0 failed. Also passes with `-W error` and on 5 repeated runs |
| Lint | `uv run ruff check .` | PASS |
| Format | `uv run ruff format --check .` | PASS |
| Build | `uv build` | PASS (wheel + sdist). The installed wheel imports and runs |
| Run | `uv run uvicorn ai_youtube_agent.main:app` | `GET /health` returns 200 with `status: ok` and the checks `settings` and `feature_flags` |

Any failure that appears after `59fcd2d` comes from a later change. It is not pre-existing.

## Bootstrap baseline

Commit `3b41416` (`chore: bootstrap ai_youtube_agent project`) is the code baseline after Project Initialization. Later commits up to `6ce7d3b` changed documentation only.

| Check | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Tests | `uv run pytest` | 1 passed, 0 failed |
| Lint | `uv run ruff check .` | PASS |
| Format | `uv run ruff format --check .` | PASS |
| Lockfile | `uv lock --check` | PASS (24 packages) |
| Build | `uv build` | PASS (wheel + sdist) |
| Run | `uv run uvicorn ai_youtube_agent.main:app` | `GET /health` returns 200 `{"status":"ok","version":"0.1.0"}` |

These checks were last run in Task 010. Any failure that appears after `3b41416` comes from a later change. It is not pre-existing.

## Invariants

Every future task must keep these true:

1. **Prompt Pack v8 is the source of truth** for task definitions. The file is `AI_YouTube_Autonomous_Agent_PROMPT_PACK_v8_BASELINE_SAFE.pdf`, stored outside the repository in `D:\Downloads`. Do not invent or guess tasks.
2. **One task at a time.** Follow Inspect → Baseline → Implement only scope → Targeted tests → Relevant regression tests → Reclassify failures → Report → PASS/FAIL. Stop after each task.
3. **Global Baseline Rule.** A task never fails because of an unrelated pre-existing error. A regression caused by the task is a FAIL. A failure of unknown origin is UNKNOWN: stop and investigate.
4. **The stack is fixed:** Python 3.11, FastAPI, uv, pytest, ruff, with the `src/` and `tests/` layout. Change it only if the user asks.
5. **Dependencies only through uv** (`uv add` / `uv add --dev`), and `uv.lock` is committed.
6. **Green gate before finishing a task:** `uv run ruff check .` and `uv run ruff format --check .` always pass; `uv build` when packaging-relevant code changed or before a checkpoint; the full `uv run python -m pytest` suite runs at most once per task, run by the main session (a coder runs it only when the brief explicitly asks), and only when justified (core or shared code, DB or migration, API contract, architecture, test infrastructure, dependency, many modules, before a checkpoint, high-risk end of task), with the reason stated when it is skipped; while iterating run the failing test id, the new tests, the affected tests and the related regression. The end-of-task report has a Tests block (new tests, affected tests, regression, full suite, migration chain: each RUN or NOT RUN with the reason).
7. **No secrets in source control.** Credentials, API keys and OAuth secrets stay out of Git. `.env` is ignored.
8. **No auto-publish and no strategy drift.** A production publish always needs a valid approval. Market, language, niche, format, budget and channel are never changed on the AI's own initiative.
9. **Do not re-run Phase 0 or re-bootstrap.** The project exists. Do not reset or delete it.
10. **Keep state files current.** Update `PROJECT_STATE.md`, `TASK_STATUS.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` at the end of each task.
11. **Push only when the user asks.**
12. **Route every task first.** Before implementing a task, classify it with the Task/Model Router (`tools/task_router.py`, policy in `.claude/task-router.json`, rules in `docs/TASK_ROUTER.md`, summary in `CLAUDE.md`) and follow the routed profile (model/effort) of each role (planner, coder, reviewer); Opus only on evidence (Opus triggers); escalate only with a reason and evidence; record runs, gate and result in the router telemetry. User overrides win unless they break a rule above.

## Workflow infrastructure

Task/Model Router (2026-10-03, after F-067; not a Prompt Pack task, so it has no TASK_STATUS row and does not change the state machine). User-approved: routed subagents per level generated from the policy (`.claude/agents/task-{planner,coder,reviewer}-<level>.md`), a deterministic scoring script with floors and tests (`tests/test_task_router.py`, 45 tests), the main session keeps the user's Opus setting (no project model setting), commit without push. Default policy: TRIVIAL haiku/low, SIMPLE sonnet/low, NORMAL sonnet/medium + planner, COMPLEX opus/high + planner + reviewer, ARCHITECTURAL opus/high + planner + reviewer + architecture review; escalation at most 2 steps up the ladder, never to xhigh/max without a user override. Nothing in `src/`, the migrations or earlier tests changed.

TOOL-002 Cost-Aware Task Router (2026-10-03, after F-069; workflow infrastructure, not a Prompt Pack task: no TASK_STATUS row, no change to `src/`, the migrations or the state machine; NEXT_TASK stays F-070). User-approved design B: complexity (score, weights, thresholds, floors, levels) is unchanged; execution is a `model/effort` profile per role from policy schema_version 2 (allowed: haiku/low, sonnet/low, sonnet/medium, sonnet/high, opus/medium, opus/high; xhigh/max only by user override). TRIVIAL coder haiku/low; SIMPLE coder sonnet/low; NORMAL planner + coder sonnet/medium (reviewer sonnet/high only for a behaviour change with a high risk); COMPLEX planner + coder sonnet/high, reviewer opus/high; ARCHITECTURAL opus/high everywhere + architecture review. Evidence-based Opus triggers from an optional risk profile (derived from the criteria when missing) lift NORMAL to opus/medium and COMPLEX to opus/high; high regression/migration risk without architecture impact raises the coder's effort on Sonnet. Escalation ladder haiku/low → … → opus/high, at most 2 steps. Subagents are named by role and profile (`.claude/agents/task-<role>-<model>-<effort>.md`, 12 files; the level-named files were removed). Append-only telemetry `.claude/router-telemetry.jsonl` (`record`, `report`, `compare`), backfilled for F-065..F-069. v1 policies and decisions still load. The per-task history paragraphs moved verbatim to `CHANGELOG.md`. `tests/test_task_router.py` now has 203 tests. Details: `docs/TASK_ROUTER.md`.

TOOL-003 Smart Test Execution (2026-10-04, after F-073; workflow infrastructure and test infrastructure, not a Prompt Pack task: no TASK_STATUS row, no change to `src/`, the migrations or any existing assertion; NEXT_TASK stays F-074). `tests/conftest.py` migrates a read-only template database once per session; the `database` fixture and `database_copy(path)` copy it per test, so normal tests no longer run the migration chain. Migration, bootstrap and upgrade tests still migrate a fresh file. `tests/test_db_template.py` guards the template. The agent texts, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/TASK_ROUTER.md` and invariant 6 encode the smart test rules (targeted first, the full suite at most once per task, owned by the main session, and only when justified, a Tests block in every report, no state-changing git for subagents). The suite has 4154 tests and runs in about 48 s. Details: `docs/TASK_ROUTER.md`, CHANGELOG.

## How to resume

```sh
git status --short --branch   # expect a clean tree on main
uv sync                       # recreate .venv if needed
uv run python -m pytest       # expect 4197 passed (132 at the A-012 baseline)
uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check .
```

Then start the task marked NOT_STARTED first in `TASK_STATUS.md`, which is F-074 right now.

The change from EMPTY to EXISTING is a valid state transition caused by Project Initialization. It is not a pre-existing failure. The files in the baseline were created by that task, so they are not PRE_EXISTING relative to the original empty state.
